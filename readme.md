# Disclaimer for Device Check Plugin

This plugin is designed to check various aspects of a device's integrity and security. While it can be a useful tool for developers and organizations seeking to enhance their app's security, please be aware of the following:

1. **No Guarantee of Complete Security**: This plugin provides checks for common indicators of device tampering or jailbreaking. However, it cannot detect all possible security vulnerabilities or modifications to a device. New methods of circumventing these checks may emerge over time.

2. **False Positives**: The checks performed by this plugin may occasionally result in false positives, especially on devices with uncommon configurations or in certain edge cases. This could potentially lead to legitimate users being incorrectly flagged.

3. **Privacy Considerations**: This plugin accesses various system paths and settings. Ensure that your use of this plugin complies with all relevant privacy laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

4. **Performance Impact**: Running these checks may have a minor impact on app performance and battery life, especially if performed frequently.

5. **Maintenance Requirements**: As mobile operating systems evolve, the effectiveness of these checks may change. Regular updates may be necessary to maintain the plugin's reliability.

6. **User Experience**: Blocking or limiting functionality based on these checks may negatively impact user experience for some individuals, potentially leading to decreased user satisfaction or app uninstalls.

7. **Not a Substitute for Secure Coding**: This plugin should be used as part of a comprehensive security strategy, not as a replacement for secure coding practices and other security measures.

8. **Potential for Reverse Engineering**: Be aware that determined attackers may attempt to reverse engineer and bypass these checks.
